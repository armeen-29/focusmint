## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend (no setup needed)

Just open `index.html` in any browser. All features except Minty AI work instantly — data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here
```

## 🧠 How the AI Works

```
Browser → POST /chat → FastAPI → LangGraph → GitHub Models (GPT-4o-mini)
                                                       ↓
Browser ← JSON reply ←─────────────────────── AI Response
```

- **LangGraph** manages the conversation graph and message state.
- **LangChain OpenAI** adapter connects to GitHub's OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint.
- Sessions are stored **in memory** on the server — a server restart clears chat history (by design for a local dev setup).
